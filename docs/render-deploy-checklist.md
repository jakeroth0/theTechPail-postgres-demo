# Render Deploy Checklist

This checklist assumes deployment from this repo's `main` branch with `render.yaml`.

## 1. Create Services from Blueprint

1. In Render, click **New** -> **Blueprint**.
2. Connect `jakeroth0/theTechPail-postgres-demo`.
3. Confirm the proposed resources from `render.yaml`:
   - Web service: `thetechpail-web`
   - Postgres database: `thetechpail-db`
4. Click **Apply**.

## 2. Wait for First Deploy

The web service uses:

- Build command: `npm ci && npm run build:css`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Health check path: `/`

Environment variables are provisioned automatically:

- `DATABASE_URL` from the managed Postgres connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` generated by Render
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `NODE_VERSION=20`

## 3. Seed Data (Optional)

If you want demo content, run once in Render Shell for `thetechpail-web`:

```bash
npm run seed
```

## 4. Smoke Test

1. Open the service URL.
2. Sign up a user.
3. Log in.
4. Create a post.
5. Add a comment.
6. Log out and log back in (session persistence check).

## 5. Portfolio Notes

In your portfolio entry, note:

1. Original app was built for Heroku + MySQL.
2. Demo deployment uses Render + Postgres to keep hosting cost low.
3. Core app architecture and UX were preserved.
